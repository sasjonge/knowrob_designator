# knowrob_designator

**Work in Progress**

This package is under active development and **not yet stable**. Interfaces, functionality, and structure may change frequently.

---

## Overview

The `knowrob_designator` package provides a ROS action interface for logging structured semantic data — called **designators** — into the [KnowRob](https://www.github.com/knowrob/knowrob) knowledge base. 

A designator is a nested symbolic description (e.g., of actions, goals, objects) expressed as a JSON structure. This structure is parsed into RDF-style triples and submitted to KnowRob using its `tell` interface.

## Running the System via Docker

This section describes how to launch the full system in a Dockerized environment.

### Start the KnowRob and Designator Action Server

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint bash knowrob_designator:latest
# Inside container:
root@<container_id>:/catkin_ws# roslaunch knowrob_designator knowrob_designator_service.launch
```

This will:

* Launch KnowRob with predefined settings
* Start the `knowrob_designator_service.py` action server

---

### In a second terminal: Run the Designator Client

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
docker exec -it <your_container_name> bash
# Inside container:
root@<container_id>:/catkin_ws# rosrun knowrob_designator knowrob_designator_client.py
```

This runs a simple client that sends a test designator to the action server. The designator is NOT parsed at the moment and not expected to be valid. 

---

## Dependencies

* ROS (Noetic recommended)
* KnowRob (`knowrob/knowrob` Docker image)
* `knowrob_ros` action interface
